SCOPE:
------

  This is IDL2Matlab / IDL2Scilab translator, version 1.6 (1 May 2013).

  This tool translates automatically an IDL code into Matlab or Scilab code.

  Contact: richard@ill.fr or farhi@ill.fr for more informations

  Restrictions:
    Graphic functions (plot, surf, widgets) are incomplete.
    Translated code is not guaranteed to work.
    Objects are not translated.

	Usage : idl2matlab [-options] inputFile [outputDirectory]

	Options :
		-s for script files translation
		-S for string translation
		-q to hide messages
		-w to stop warnings writing
		-t to print the abstract tree
		-V to get idl2Matlab version
		-Tx to get x spaces for a tabulation x<10
		-f to translate only one function
		-C to translate in Scilab (default : Matlab)

	Examples :
		idl2matlab -qw essai.pro outDir/
		idl2matlab -t essai.pro outDir/ > out
		idl2matlab -S "print,'IDL2Matlab'"
		idl2matlab -T4 essai.pro outDir/ > out
		idl2matlab -f essai.pro functionName outDir/ > out
		
	See the idl2matlab man page or HTML page in the IDL2MATLAB/doc library.

LINUX INSTALLATION: 
-------------------
Requirements: Linux system, C compiler (and optionally bison, flex)

	1- If you have super user permissions

		# unzip idl2matlab-X.Y.zip
		# cd idl2matlab-X.Y
		# ./configure
		# make
		# make install

	This will install the library in /usr/local/lib/idl2matlab, 
	and binary 'idl2matlab' in /usr/local/bin/

	2- If you are NOT superuser (using $HOME=~):
		$ unzip idl2matlab-X.Y.zip
		$ cd idl2matlab-X.Y
		$ ./configure --prefix=$HOME
		$ make
		$ make install
	 then
		$tcsh: setenv IDL2MATLAB ~/lib/idl2matlab/
	 or
		$bash: export IDL2MATLAB=~/lib/idl2matlab/
	 to define the user based library location. This command should be set each time
	 you wish to use idl2matlab. It may be added to your environment scripts.
	 Executable is then located in ~/bin

GCC >= 4 installs a stack protector which leads to a stack overflow error. 
Add the '-fno-stack-protector' and remove the optimization '-O2' to the CFLAGS 
variable in the Makefile.

WINDOWS INSTALLATION:
---------------------
Requirements: Windows system, C compiler, administrator permissions.

	1- install a C compiler, such as the free Dev-Cpp <http://www.bloodshed.net/dev/devcpp.html>
	2- extract the idl2matlab-X.Y.zip
	3- open the idl2matlab-X.Y folder
	4- double click on the install.bat script in the package source.

	This will install the library in C:\IDL2MATLAB, 
	and binary 'idl2matlab' in C:\IDL2MATLAB\BIN

	5- log-out and log-in again to have PATH and environment variables updated.
	6- in case you do not have the permissions to automatically update these,
	open the Computer properties and add the path to idl2matlab.exe at the end of the
	PATH environment variable.

GCC >= 4 installs a stack protector which leads to a stack overflow error. 
Add the '-fno-stack-protector' and remove the optimization '-O2' to the CFLAGS 
variable in the Makefile.

MATLAB USAGE:
--------------------
Requirements: Matlab, idl2matlab executable and library installed

We provide an 'idl2matlab.m' function for Matlab, which calls the executable. 
It is then required to have idl2matlab properly installed (see previous sections).

>> idl2matlab('file.pro');

will convert the file from IDL to Matlab code and load the IDL compatibility library.


USAGE as a command (does not require IDL nor Matlab):
------------------

You may use idl2matlab with

# idl2matlab examples/test.pro

will generate the test.m Matlab function.
The log of the translation is written to file 'idl2matlab.log' and
the translation returns 0 when no error is found.

In order to load the IDL compatibility library
within Matlab, type at the prompt (from distribution directory):

>>  p=pwd;
>>  cd /usr/local/lib/idl2matlab/ % (or your local '~/lib/idl2matlab')
>>  i2m_init;
>>  cd(p);

Within Scilab, type at the prompt (from distribution directory):

>  chdir('/usr/local/lib/idl2matlab') # (or your local '~/lib/idl2matlab')
>  exec('i2s_init',-1);

These may be automatically executed when starting Matlab/Scilab. Refer to startup scripts
for these languages.


The step-by-step procedure for compilation is something like:
  bison -v -d idl2matlab.y --output-file=idl2matlab.c
  flex -i idl2matlab.l
  gcc -c -g idl2matlab.c
  gcc -c -g main.c
  gcc -c -g tree.c
  gcc -c -g code.c
  gcc -c -g rename.c
  gcc -c -g lib.c
  gcc -c -g hashtable.c
  gcc -c -g table_symb.c
  gcc -c -g lex.yy.c
  gcc -g main.o idl2matlab.o tree.o hashtable.o table_symb.o rename.o lex.yy.o lib.o code.o -o idl2matlab

GCC >= 4 installs a stack protector which leads to a stack overflow error. 
Add the '-fno-stack-protector' and remove the optimization '-O2' to the CFLAGS 
variable in the Makefile.
